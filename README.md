# 'Shop It: A Simple Barbershop Harmonizer

Enter a sequence of pitches in C Major, then click "Harmonize" to see various barbershop chord progressions for that melody. Brought to you by recursive backtracking.

### Examples

- **Down Our Way**: `E B A G A E D`
- **Mary Had a Little Lamb**: `E D C D E E E`
- **Chromatic scale**: `C C# D D# E F F# G`
- **Santa Fe**: `G(G7) F E(C) G F E(Am7)`

### Notes

- **Forced chords.** You can force a particular chord for a particular melody note. Just put the chord name in parentheses after the pitch: F#(D7). Make sure the forced chord actually contains the pitch—you won't see any validation messages or error messages if not.
- **Progression permissivity.** You can decide whether to allow only basic Circle of Fifths motion (e.g. II7 → V7 → I) or additional progressions as well (e.g. I#7 → I7, tritone substitution). Permitting all progressions will give many more results.
- **Melody length.** For performance reasons, melodies can be at most 15 pitches long. Computating anything longer would likely cook your browser.
- **Letter casing.** Case matters only for chord names (e.g. because AM7 and Am7 are distinct chords). Case does not matter for pitch names.
- **Playing chords.** You can play through progressions using [Keyano](https://cmslewis.github.io/keyano), a browser-based piano, if you want.

## How this works

While arranging barbershop music, I've often wished for a tool that could quickly show me all legal-ish chord progressions that are possible for a certain sequence of melody notes. This is a scrappy, two-day attempt at building such a tool.

This is a decidedly **rules-bdased** harmonization engine. That means that there is an explicit, curated list of rules dictating how each chord is allowed to progress. For instance, G7 may always go to C, while C can go anywhere, since it's the tonic. The rules are stitched together to build a graph of all possible chord progressions, then for a given melody, recursive backtracking is used to find all harmonic paths "out of the maze." This system isn't particularly robust&mdash;it's mostly just a quick proof of concept. But it does spit out some interesting results!

This is intentionally _not_ powered by a Machine Learning model. In the past, I built an ML model for harmonizing melodies using a [Hidden Markov Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) trained on Bach chorales. That approach may yield a more statistically defensible result for any given melody, but it would have required more training data than I had time to create, and it also tends to give boring, least-common-denominator harmonizations. In contrast, the rules-based engine here just returns all reasonable-ish progressions for you to peruse. The result is a much greater appreciation for the complexities of barbershop arranging. :)
